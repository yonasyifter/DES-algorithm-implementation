This is DES algorithm implementation to encrypt the message for secure transmission accros the network (transmission media ) in nutshell to satisfay the CIA, 
the implemented algorithm Designed to encode the input message from the command prompt then, 
The message is Encryption process follows the diagram below

While Decoding the ciphered data (Decoding algorithm) i got some problem it is not implemented as i wish it to be. 
here i may seek your help but never give up fixing it. to implement this what i have done is
